# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Project_10_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Model Performance
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
